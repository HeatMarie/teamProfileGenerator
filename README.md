## Assignment

### Object-Oriented Programming: Team Profile Generator 

#### Task

- Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 

- Testing is key to making code maintainable, so you'll also write a unit test for every part of your code and ensures that it passes each test. 

## Installation

1. Make sure to have your favorite code editor installed and ready to use. 
2. Ensure that git is installed. 
2. Download Node.js and npm package manager <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank"> here </a>
3. Fork this repo.
4. Clone it baby! 
5. Open the app up in the code editor
6. Use the terminal, node and npm to install all the needed things.
7. Inside the terminal type "node index.js" 
8. Work the magic and answer the questions

## Comments 

And then it was done! Yes, it could be dressed up a bit more, things could look a little prettier, and when I get time, that is the goal! However, what we have here my lovelies is a fun little doohickey that will help you put together and compile employee information all in one spot in a quick and easy fashion. 

I can't help but love Node.js. We have a full on love relationship here. We get along and will be besties, I am sure of it. 

The hardest part is knowing where to start. So in the beginning I began with a simple TODO list that borders on the line of pseudocode.

Then I created the classes, moved on to the index, and finally generating the HTML which did cause me the most of problems. As per usual, we can't get away without a little struggle, I mean, what is the fun in that?
